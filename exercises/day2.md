### `try` statement exercises
1. Write a program to read two numbers: `x` and `y` from standard input and print the result of `x / y`. 
If the user inputs invalid data, display an error message and exit gracefully. 

### Lists exercises
1. Given the following list:
    ```python
    l = [4, 6, 1, 7, 8, 2, 8, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9]
    ```
    * Add elements from `[5, 7, 8]` to the end of the list
    * Print the length of the list
    * Check if `8` is in the list
    * Print the first position of `7` in the list
    * Count how many times `8` is in the list
    * Reverse the list
    * Sort the list
    * Remove items on last two positions
    * Remove all items on positions divisible by 3
2. Write a Python program to convert a list of characters into a string.
3. Write a Python program to find the second-smallest number in a list.
4. Given two lists, create a list of tuples where element on position `n` is a
tuple of elements on position `n` from each list. If one list is longer than the
other, ignore extra elements.

    E.g. `["Anna", "John", "Marie"]`, `[12, 15, 22, 13]` -> 
         `[("Anna", 12), ("John", 15), ("Marie", 22)]`
